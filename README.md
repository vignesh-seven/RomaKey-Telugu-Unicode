# RomaKey-Telugu-Unicode  
Romic Keyboard for Unicode Typing in Telugu  

This is a small program for unicode telugu typing on Windows PCs without needing Anu Script or Google Input Tools
RomaKey is based on Romic Keyboard layout from Anu Script Manager.  
But this is faster, simpler, and uses less resources.  

# Installation  
No installation. Just download and double-click .exe file!  
# Keyboard Layout  
Here's the keyboard layout of this program.

# How to Use  
1. Double-click .exe file to start RomaKey to type in telugu.  
2. An icon will appear in system tray to indicate the program is running.  
3. Press F11 key to pause/resume RomaKey.  
4. Right-click system tray icon and click exit to close the program.  

Note : You can also download additional Telugu Unicode Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?subset=telugu) and [Sillicon Andhra Fonts](https://fonts.siliconandhra.org/)  

## Why does this exist? 
There are many tools that you can use to already type in telugu in Unicode, but people don't use them.  
Why? because they don't follow the keyboard layouts that people are used to from Anu Script Manager (Apple, Roma etc.)   
So, this is a tool that'll let you use the already familiar Roma keyboard layout for typing (although it's a bit tweaked) to type in Unicode.
